# WebDev Guide starts here!

This is meant to be a guide for absolute beginners with no coding experience to get started with web development. You can use the resources linked below to get started (If you end up hating this guide, feel free to yell at Rithik in the 21 Days of Code [discord server](https://discord.gg/MwyxAJgA) (yup, we have a discord server (if you didn't know for some reason) because we're cool like that!) for writing this abomination of a guide).

**Disclaimer:** Web development, just like any other topic, is an EXTREMELY deep rabbit-hole. So, it is very important that you do not take in too much information at once and get overwhelmed by how much stuff there is to process!

***

**More stuff you can safely ignore:**

There are way too many options to choose from in both the frontend, and backend sides of webdev, and it is not humanly possible to analyse and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each framework to select the optimal framework to learn.

Also, do not expect to become an expert web dev and add it to your CV as soon as the challenge ends! The resources provided down below only aim to provide a very basic working-level understanding. To really get good at it, always read the docs! But do not try to jump directly into the docs when you're just starting out. Learn from videos at first instead, and when you're starting to feel comfortable, you can move on to attacking the documentation, piece by pice. Maybe for JavaScript,start with the 'this' keyword for example.

Do note, that you can follow this guide with different frameworks or IDEs to get started with webdev. This guide will cover setting up VSCode, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## **How to get started with WebDev**

Watch the [Intro to WebDev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEN5RaKOlA) video to understand what you will be getting into. Once you do that, you can go on to set up an IDE before jumping in to start coding. [Setting up the IDE (VSCode)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NfFFsQC77M).

These videos should help you understand what [HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok-plXXHlWw), [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEV8gMkCHXQ) are.

Look for YouTube channels whose paces seems comfortable for you and watch them! Or you could use watch these videos I personally really liked:

[HTML Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiQ9rjaa2Ow) and [CSS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfjd5yzCaxk). You should be able to make very basic static websites with just HTML, and once you're comfortable with HTML, you can move on to theming those websites with CSS.

If these courses were too fast for you, check out [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-css-tutorial-build-a-recipe-website/)'s tutorials (I personally find freecodecamp very slow-paced, but their content is excellent).

You don't need to spend too much time on HTML, and also, **don't** get stuck trying to learn the tags. Get familiar with a few tags through YouTube, and then move on to making static HTML sites, and looking up a list of html tags on google, and playing around with them.  
*Learn the tags as you make webpages, don't go out of your way to learn and memorize all of them!*

It's the same story with CSS.

Now that you can make static websites with ease, you can move on to watching the [Intro to JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upDLs1sn7g4) and getting a sense for what dynamic webpages are. Then, move on to the [JavaScript Starter Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk) for a well paced but very basic JavaScript tutorial. This is not very comprehensive, but it won't bore the life out of you, unlike a lot of other tutorials out there.

Watch [JavaScript Frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka77djMkSwg) to understand why they are a thing and why it will immensely help you to learn a JS Framework. Do watch a few more advanced JavaScript tutorials and before moving onto learning a framework.

If you've come this far, you might be wondering which framework to choose to learn out of the billion options out there, and this was a particularly painful choice to make for me, but you will do well enough just going with ReactJS for the frontend, and NodeJS for the backend. Don't stress too much about it! (Also don't forget to attack me for choosing to learn [ReactJS](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8) instead of [Angular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko) or [Vue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhBVL41-_Cw) or [Svelte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) or [Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4B69HAOXnA) or whatever your favorite framework is)!

Do look into Web3 as well! It's still in its infancy, so it's fun! :)

Happy Web-Devving!
