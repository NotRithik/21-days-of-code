The CS Society is hosting this challenge to motivate you to make a habit out of programming while concurrently lending your hand in building a library of handy solutions that could help others in need.

This is open to complete beginners, and a list of resources have been compiled to get you rolling: [21 Days of Code Resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1MvR449gHhKe0jkpLwJi9X080wpb3nNwr)

To track your progress, fork this repo: [21 Days of Code](https://github.com/cs-ashoka/21-days-of-code)

## Rules:
* Code for at least an hour every day for the next 21 days.
* However, you will not be disqualified if you miss a day or two, but try your best remain consistent and not miss the challenge two days in a row or more.

## Why should you do this?
These problems are cunningly crafted to help you flex those brain muscles to conquer the most important skill of all: googling, or more philosophically, self-learning.

Also, this challenge will help you overcome the monkey of procrastination by developing a healthy habit of coding. Through religiously sticking to your commitment of learning in tidbits daily, you will learn/get better at coding in next to no time.

***

## How will this work?
**tl;dr:** Choose questions, code, submit the problem with a working solution, check out the leaderboard, don’t stress yourself out, enjoy the process and find yourself learning.

Every day, 4 questions plus 1 featured question will be posted on the repository. You can choose to solve all the questions, or only the questions that interest you, as long as you code for at least one hour every day. Submit Pull Requests with the code that you have solved. Only working solutions will be merged. You can code in any language you want (maybe even check out esoteric languages like [brainfu**m**k](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck), or [Folders](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Folders) they’re cool!).

There will be a leaderboard which will keep track of the number of commits that have been accepted.

Time yourself coding. Take breaks in between. Try out [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) (or [Animedoro](https://deepstash.com/idea/77397/whats-the-animedoro-technique), if that’s your thing!). Do whatever your heart says as long as it is not against the sacred law of an hour of coding every day (without burning yourself out, stay hydrated). Remember, consistency is key.

## Naming your files
Please name your file as **ProblemName_YourGitHubID.extension**
**Example :** If I am submitting a solution to the [Happy Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/) problem, my submission file should be named **HappyNumbers_vaibhavsh7.py** (File extension depends on the language of your choice)

## Structure
We have changed the structure of the repository to make things easier for participants. Instead of submitting your solution in the folder of the platform of the question concerned, we now have folders pertaining to the day of the problem.

**Example :** Today's solutions [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/) and [Total Expenses]((https://www.codechef.com/problems/FLOW009)) should be submitted in the Day 2 folder and the README.md inside that folder shall be changed only.

## How to edit the README.md file
To make things simpler, we have added a template to the README.md file.
```
| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty | GitHub ID |
|---| ----- | -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Enter the Quesion Number here | [Enter the Question Name here](Enter the link to the question here) | [Name of the language used to solve the question](link to the solution) | Easy | [Your GitHub username](link to your GitHub ID) |
```
Enter the required text in the spaces provided above, please do not remove the [] or () or | symbols, only change the text within them.
Example, remove "Enter the Question here" to enter the question name, in case of Happy Number, it's 202, so the README.md file should now look like : 
```
| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty | GitHub ID |
|---| ----- | -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 202 | [Enter the Question Name here](Enter the link to the question here) | [Name of the language used to solve the question](link to the solution) | Easy | [Your GitHub username](link to your GitHub ID) |
```
Next, edit the "Enter the Question Name here" like this :
```
| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty | GitHub ID |
|---| ----- | -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 202 | [Happy Number](Enter the link to the question here) | [Name of the language used to solve the question](link to the solution) | Easy | [Your GitHub username](link to your GitHub ID) |
```
Now, replace "Enter the link to the question here" :
```
| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty | GitHub ID |
|---| ----- | -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 202 | [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/) | [Name of the language used to solve the question](link to the solution) | Easy | [Your GitHub username](link to your GitHub ID) |
```
Repeat these steps for all of the columns.
