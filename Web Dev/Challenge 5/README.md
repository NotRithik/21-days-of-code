# Challenge 5
Create a CSS file to make the given (use the HTML file given) webpage look like the given image, **without using any formatting tags in the HTML**!

You may change any element's ID, Class or add Divs anywhere you want, but again, **do not do the actual formatting in HTML, *please*!** (Doing that would make CSS pointless, and also, remember that this is a challenge!)

Submit a pull request with the HTML and CSS file names formatted as mentioned in the WebDev README!

It doesn't have to be an EXACT match, it just has to look close enough to the screenshot. Also, feel free to use any fonts you like!
